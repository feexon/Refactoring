# Inline Method
> A method's body is just as clear as its name.
> Put the method's body into body of its callers and remove the method.


## Motivation

- The body of a method is just as clear as its name.
- You have a group of methods that seem badly refactored.you can inline them all into one big method and then re-extract the method.
